# Virtual-Risc-Processor
Program that reads code, converts it into machine language, and feeds it into a virtual RISC processor. This program was built using Java and is still a work in progress.

In order to have the program read code, you must follow what I have done in cpu_test2 and cpu_test3. I plan on having the program create a textbox to directly
write the code in. Then you would be able to click a button to make the program run the code.

Work to be done: 
Clean up the cpu file code.
Make a gui.
